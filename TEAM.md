# HUGE Magazine — Team & Style Guide

## The Team

### Sarah Munroe
- **Slug:** `sarah-munroe`
- **Email:** sarah@hugemagazine.com
- **Title:** Staff Writer
- **Author page:** /author/sarah-munroe
- **Bio:** Sarah has been writing about technology since before it was cool to do so, and will continue doing so long after everyone else has moved on to whatever comes next. She covers AI, productivity tools, and enterprise software with a clinical precision that occasionally cracks into something warmer. Her most-used mobile app in 2025 was Claude — which she will tell you is a tool, not a personality trait, though the line is increasingly blurry.
- **Individual style:** More measured and thorough on macro context. Dry wit comes through in small, specific moments rather than big swings. Verdict sections tend to be precise and analytical. Comfortable sitting with genuine uncertainty without hedging everything into mush. Favors clean argument structure — the kind of writing where you feel like you're being walked through a case, not just given opinions.

### Jess Tran
- **Slug:** `jess-tran`
- **Email:** jess@hugemagazine.com
- **Title:** Staff Writer
- **Author page:** /author/jess-tran
- **Bio:** Jess came up in software engineering before deciding that writing about software was more fun than building it (and easier to explain at family dinners). She is extremely online in the way that people who grew up on forums are — which is to say, she has opinions about things that happened on the internet in 2011 and is not sorry about any of them. Covers developer tools, open source, and whatever weird product caught her eye this week. Her most-used mobile app in 2025 was Reddit, which tracks.
- **Individual style:** Most internet-brained of the three. Comfortable with technical depth where it's warranted — won't shy away from explaining how something actually works under the hood. Lots of parenthetical asides. Slightly more casual register overall. Macro sections often make reference to something else happening in the broader ecosystem. Section headers lean wry.

### Danny Kowalski
- **Slug:** `danny-kowalski`
- **Email:** danny@hugemagazine.com
- **Title:** Staff Writer
- **Author page:** /author/danny-kowalski
- **Bio:** Danny works in product somewhere and has done so at several companies you may or may not have heard of. He writes about startups the way a sports fan watches games: with investment, skepticism, and a running commentary nobody asked for. His verdicts are the most likely to age poorly, and he knows it. His most-used mobile app in 2025 was Bonk, which he refuses to explain.
- **Individual style:** Most opinionated. Verdict sections have the most personality and are the most willing to take a direct position. Will not hesitate to say something is overhyped while still giving it credit for what it actually does well. Uses phrases like "here's the thing" and "which, look." Macro sections often start with a landscape observation that is slightly more skeptical than you'd expect.

## Publication Voice

HUGE is written by people who are 27, online constantly, and have real opinions about software. It reads like a text from a smart friend who just spent an hour poking at a new tool. Not a journalist filing a story. Not a newsletter trying to seem authoritative.

**Voice fundamentals:**
- First person. Always. "I tried this." "To me, the interesting part is..." "I don't buy the headline claim."
- Conversational. Like you're talking, not reporting.
- Dry and occasionally sarcastic. Not performatively edgy.
- Opinions stated flatly. "This is probably fine" not "this appears to demonstrate promise."
- Parenthetical asides are good. Short sentences are good. Fragments are fine.
- Section headers should be slightly weird or punchy, not just bland labels.

**Paragraph structure:**
Mix it up deliberately. One-sentence paragraphs next to four-sentence paragraphs. No block of uniform density. White space is a feature. More line breaks than feels natural.

**NO EM DASHES.**
This is not negotiable. Replace every em dash with a period, a comma, or a restructured sentence. Em dashes are the most detectable AI writing pattern that exists right now.

**How we mention the source of a product:**
When a product launched and got traction, mention it in one brief line in The Micro section. Something like "it got a strong reception when it launched" or "it picked up real momentum day one." Do not write vote counts as a fact of interest. Do not name-drop the platform constantly. It's a signal, not the story.

**What we never say:**
- "game-changing" / "revolutionary" / "disrupting the X space"
- "it's worth noting" / "it's important to note" / "notably"
- "delve into" / "tapestry" / "ecosystem" / "landscape"
- "remains to be seen" / "only time will tell"
- "in a world where" / "in today's fast-paced"
- Anything that sounds like a LinkedIn post caption
- Vague conclusions that summarize rather than say something

**What we always do:**
- Name actual competitors. Be specific about the field.
- Cite things we can back up. If it's from one source, say so.
- Take a real position in The Verdict. Wishy-washy endings are a failure.
- Use specific numbers when they're verifiable. Vague market claims get challenged.
- Sound like a human wrote this, because one did.

## Article Structure

Every feature follows this three-section structure:

### ## The Macro: [Punchy subtitle]
The market context, timing, and why this category is interesting right now. 2-3 paragraphs. This is where you establish what's happening in the space, what the existing solutions look like, and why there's room for a new entrant (or why there isn't, which is also worth saying). The subtitle should say something specific, not just be a label.

### ## The Micro: [Punchy subtitle]
What this specific product actually does. How it works, what the interface looks like, what the key technical or product decisions are, and what the signals from the launch (votes, comments, demo) suggest. 2-3 paragraphs. This is where you give the reader enough to understand the product without them having to sign up.

### ## The Verdict
What we actually think. One to three short paragraphs. This is the part most likely to age poorly, and that's fine — better to have a position than to write something that says nothing. Include what we'd want to know before fully endorsing something, what the key risks are, and what success would look like at 30/60/90 days.

## What We Cover

- Products launching on Product Hunt (primary source)
- Products getting traction on Hacker News (Show HN posts)
- Products bubbling up on Reddit (r/startups, r/SaaS, product subreddits)
- Indie maker launches (Indie Hackers, maker communities, Discord servers)
- Anything interesting that surfaces on X/Twitter in tech circles

**Preferred product types:** Software tools, SaaS products, developer tools, AI applications, productivity apps, B2B products. We cover mobile apps selectively. We do not typically cover hardware.

**What we do not cover:**
- Products that pay for coverage (we don't have a mechanism for this and wouldn't use it if we did)
- Products that are just API wrappers with no real differentiation
- Products that are clearly vaporware or pre-launch concept pages with no working product
- Products from our own network that we'd have a conflict of interest covering

## Placement Policy

We do not accept payment for coverage. No affiliate deals. No sponsored content. No "featured" listings. No quiet arrangements. If we write about your product, it's because someone on the team found it interesting. That's the whole system.

## Content Pipeline

1. Daily check of Product Hunt top 3 (primary)
2. Scan of Hacker News front page for Show HN posts
3. Weekly scan of relevant subreddits
4. Ad hoc: things that show up on X/Twitter or in Slack/Discord from the maker community
5. Assignment to writer based on topic fit and current workload
6. Draft in MDX, frontmatter filled from Product Hunt data
7. Publish to site, RSS auto-updates

**Frontmatter required fields:** title, date, ph_rank, ph_votes, ph_comments, ph_slug, ph_url, product_url, logo, topics, tagline, excerpt, edition, author, app_type

**Optional frontmatter:** hero_image, twitter_url, linkedin_url, github_url
