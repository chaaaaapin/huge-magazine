# HUGE Magazine

**Domain:** hugemagazine.com (29-year-old domain)
**Tagline:** "Where Innovation Meets Impact"
**Position:** MIT Technology Review meets Wired — accessible innovation journalism with visual punch

**Created:** February 3, 2026
**Status:** Pre-Launch Planning

---

## The Vision

HUGE Magazine is the definitive destination for breakthrough ideas, emerging technologies, and the innovations shaping tomorrow. We cover what's next before it's mainstream, with the editorial rigor of MIT Technology Review and the visual audacity of Wired.

**We exist for one reason:** To make complex, world-changing ideas accessible and exciting for the people who need to understand them.

### What We Are
- A magazine about **ideas**, not products
- A publication that assumes reader sophistication without requiring expertise
- A visual experience where design is co-equal with writing
- An authority that takes positions, not a stenographer of competing views

### What We're Not
- A tech news aggregator
- A gadget review site
- A startup cheerleader
- An AI hype machine

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Innovation-minded professionals (28-50)
- Tech executives, founders, investors
- Innovation managers at large companies
- Researchers crossing from academia to industry
- Consultants advising on technology strategy

**Secondary:** Ambitious generalists
- Intellectually curious professionals in any field
- Graduate students and early-career researchers
- Policy makers and regulators touching tech
- Journalists covering technology

**Psychographic:** People who read one book a month, listen to podcasts while running, and want to understand where the world is going — not just what's trending today.

## Editorial Philosophy

### Voice & Tone

**We sound like:** A brilliant friend who happens to work in tech — someone who can explain quantum computing over dinner without being condescending, and who has strong opinions about what it means for the world.

**We are:**
- **Confident, not arrogant** — We take positions. We make calls. We don't hedge everything.
- **Accessible, not dumbed-down** — We explain complex ideas clearly without patronizing.
- **Opinionated, not preachy** — We have a point of view. We don't lecture.
- **Curious, not credulous** — We're excited about innovation but skeptical of hype.
- **Visual, not decorative** — Design serves storytelling. Every image earns its place.

**We never sound like:**
- Corporate press releases
- Academic papers
- Tech bro Twitter
- Breathless AI hype blogs

### Headline Philosophy

Following MIT Tech Review's approach: **Declarative over interrogative.**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Is AI About to Transform Healthcare?" | "AI Is Transforming Healthcare. Here's How." |
| "Could Quantum Computing Break Encryption?" | "Quantum Computing Will Break Encryption. The Race to Prepare Has Begun." |
| "What Does the Future Hold for Clean Energy?" | "Clean Energy's Next Decade: Three Bets That Will Define It" |

**Headlines should:**
- Make a claim
- Signal the stakes
- Create urgency without clickbait

### Editorial Judgment

We don't do "false balance." When one side is clearly right — scientifically, ethically, practically — we say so. We're journalists, not stenographers.

**This means:**
- Climate change is real and urgent
- AI has genuine transformative potential AND genuine risks
- Not every startup deserves coverage just because it raised money
- Some "disruption" is just repackaged extraction

## Content Pillars

### 1. Breakthrough Technologies
Deep dives into the science and engineering behind transformative technologies.

**Topics:** AI/ML, quantum computing, biotech/genomics, clean energy, materials science, space technology, brain-computer interfaces

**Format:** 2,000-4,000 word features with custom diagrams, explainer sidebars, expert interviews

**Goal:** Be the place people go to actually understand how emerging tech works

### 2. HUGE Ideas (Signature Feature)
Weekly spotlight on a single breakthrough concept, company, or person creating massive impact.

**Format:** 3,000-5,000 words, bespoke visual design per story (Wired's "wrong theory" approach — each story gets its own look)

**Selection criteria:**
- Scale of potential impact (must be genuinely HUGE)
- Timeliness (why now?)
- Accessibility (can we make this interesting to non-specialists?)
- Originality (are we adding something no one else has said?)

### 3. Innovation Case Studies
How breakthroughs actually happen — the messy, nonlinear reality of turning ideas into impact.

**Topics:** R&D process, scaling challenges, regulatory navigation, team building, funding strategies

**Format:** 2,000-3,000 words, timeline infographics, decision-tree diagrams

**Goal:** Useful for people building things, not just observing them

### 4. Visionary Profiles
In-depth conversations with the people driving breakthrough thinking.

**Format:** Long-form interviews (Q&A or narrative), portrait photography, career timeline

**Selection criteria:**
- Genuine originality of thought (not just success)
- Willingness to go deep (no PR-approved talking points)
- Diversity of perspective (not just Bay Area VC-backed founders)

### 5. Future Dispatches (Opinion)
Sharp, provocative takes on technology's intersection with society, policy, and culture.

**Format:** 800-1,500 words, bylined opinion pieces
**Voice:** Argumentative, evidence-based, willing to be controversial

**Topics:** AI governance, climate policy, tech regulation, innovation culture, ethical dilemmas

## Visual Identity & Brand Design

### Logo Concept

**Primary Mark:** The word "HUGE" in a bold, geometric sans-serif with a distinctive element — the "U" contains a subtle upward arrow, suggesting growth, breakthrough, ascent.

**Symbol:** The "U" with arrow can work as standalone favicon and social icon.

**Tagline lockup:** "HUGE" above "Where Innovation Meets Impact" in lighter weight

**Usage:**
- Full lockup for headers and formal use
- "HUGE" wordmark for editorial contexts
- U-arrow symbol for favicon, app icon, social avatars

### Typography System

Following MIT Tech Review's approach — three complementary typefaces:

| Role | Typeface | Use |
|------|----------|-----|
| **Display** | Monument Extended (or similar geometric extended sans) | Headlines, cover lines, big statements |
| **Body** | Söhne or Inter (clean, highly readable sans) | Article body, extended reading |
| **Accent** | JetBrains Mono or IBM Plex Mono | Data, code, sidebars, captions |

**Why this works:**
- Extended display font signals ambition and boldness ("HUGE" energy)
- Clean sans body respects reader time and attention
- Mono accent connects to tech subject matter without being cliché

### Color Palette

**Primary:**
| Color | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **HUGE Black** | #0D0D0D | Primary text, headlines |
| **HUGE White** | #FAFAFA | Backgrounds, reverse text |
| **Electric Blue** | #0066FF | Primary accent, links, CTAs |

**Secondary:**
| Color | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Innovation Orange** | #FF6B35 | Secondary accent, highlights, alerts |
| **Deep Purple** | #5B21B6 | Premium content, special features |
| **Success Green** | #10B981 | Positive data, growth indicators |

**Tertiary (Data Viz):**
| Color | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| **Cyan** | #06B6D4 | Charts, graphs |
| **Magenta** | #EC4899 | Charts, graphs |
| **Yellow** | #FBBF24 | Highlights, callouts |

**Philosophy:** Electric Blue as primary accent says "tech" without saying "boring enterprise." Orange adds energy and warmth. Purple signals premium. The palette is vibrant but not childish — serious publication energy.

### Grid System

**12-column flexible grid** (MIT Tech Review approach)
- Allows for diverse layouts without chaos
- Supports sidebars, pull quotes, infographics
- Works across desktop, tablet, mobile
- Articles can be 8-col body + 4-col sidebar, or full-width immersive

### Photography & Imagery

**Approach:** Custom over stock. Always.

**Portrait photography:**
- Clean backgrounds, dramatic lighting
- Show subjects in their environment when possible
- Avoid corporate headshot energy

**Concept photography:**
- Abstract, evocative, interpretive
- Should make you stop scrolling
- Commission illustrators for complex concepts

**Data visualization:**
- Custom charts, never Excel defaults
- Treat infographics as storytelling, not decoration
- Use brand colors consistently
- Interactive on web where it adds value

**Illustration:**
- For concepts too abstract for photography
- Distinctive house style (to be developed)
- Mix of editorial illustration and technical diagrams

### Layout Principles

**Following Wired's "Wrong Theory":**
1. Master the fundamentals first
2. Then deliberately break one rule per layout
3. The break works because everything else is solid

**Examples:**
- Perfect grid, then one image breaks the column
- Consistent typography, then one headline is MASSIVE
- Clean whitespace, then one spread is dense with data

**Each HUGE Ideas feature gets bespoke design** — no templates for signature content.
