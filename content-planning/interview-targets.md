5. Offer something: pre-release of relevant research, exclusive platform

### For Tier 3-4
1. Direct Twitter/LinkedIn outreach with specific pitch
2. Reference their recent work/papers
3. Offer to cover their research area more broadly
4. Quick turnaround on scheduling
5. Share draft before publish (builds trust)
