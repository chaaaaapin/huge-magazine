## SEO Strategy Notes

### Link Building Priorities
1. **Expert interviews** — each interview subject likely to share/link
2. **Original data/research** — linkable asset strategy
3. **Definitive guides** — pillar pages as link magnets
4. **Trend predictions** — cited when trends materialize

### Content Velocity
- **Month 1-3:** 2 articles/week (establish quality baseline)
- **Month 4-6:** 3 articles/week (build volume)
- **Month 7-12:** 4-5 articles/week (scale with systems)

### Keyword Difficulty Approach
- **Launch:** Target low-difficulty, lower-volume keywords to establish rankings
- **Month 3-6:** Move into medium-difficulty keywords with proven authority
- **Month 6+:** Compete for high-volume head terms

### Internal Linking Structure
Every article should link to:
1. Its cluster pillar page
2. 2-3 related articles in same cluster
3. 1-2 articles in adjacent clusters
4. Relevant HUGE Breakthrough features
