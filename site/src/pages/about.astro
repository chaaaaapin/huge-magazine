Covers developer tools, open source, and whatever weird product caught her eye this week. Her most-used mobile app in 2025 was Reddit, which tracks.",

        <h1 class="about-title">What is HUGE?</h1>

        <p class="about-lead">
          We are a team of nerds who watch all of the major forums, message boards, subreddits, and corners of the internet where new products surface — Hacker News, Reddit, indie maker communities, launch Discord servers, and anywhere else interesting things tend to appear first. Every day we look at what's launching, what's getting traction, and what's actually worth talking about.
        </p>

        <p class="about-para">
          The internet generates a lot of product launches. Most of them are not interesting. A small number of them are genuinely novel, well-timed, or solving a problem that a lot of people have and haven't articulated yet. We try to find those and write about them before they become obvious — which means sometimes we're early and sometimes we're wrong, and we're fine with both of those outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-section">What we actually do</h2>

        <p class="about-para">
          We write features, not press releases. The goal is to give a real take on what a product is, why it exists, who built it, and whether it matters — not just to repeat the founder's launch copy back at you. Every piece has three sections: the macro context (what's happening in the space), the micro detail (what this specific product actually does), and a verdict (what we actually think). The verdict is the part that's most likely to age badly, which is part of why we write it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-section">We are not paid for placements</h2>

        <p class="about-para">
          We are emphatically, aggressively not paid for placements. No affiliate deals. No sponsored content. No "featured" listings, no "premium partner" tiers, no quiet arrangements where a founder sends us something nice and then we happen to be very enthusiastic about their launch. This is a hobby site run by people who find this stuff genuinely interesting. If we write about your product, it's because we wanted to.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-section">The kind of people we are</h2>

        <p class="about-para">
          We'd describe ourselves as the kind of people who still have open tabs from three weeks ago about something they read on Hacker News. We think software is fascinating, startups are frequently absurd, and the gap between what a product claims to do and what it actually does is one of the most interesting things to write about. We are not trying to be neutral — we have opinions — but we try to be fair, and we try to be specific about what we actually know versus what we're guessing.
