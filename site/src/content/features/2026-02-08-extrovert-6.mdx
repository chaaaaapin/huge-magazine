## The Macro: Cold Outreach Is Broken and Everyone Knows It

Here's the thing about LinkedIn in 2025: it has become, somewhat against its will, the last remaining channel where a salesperson can reach a stranger without being immediately filtered into oblivion. Email open rates have cratered under the weight of a decade of automation abuse. Cold calling is a numbers game that requires numbers most small teams don't have. And yet LinkedIn — creaky, corporate, deeply weird as a social network — still works, at least for now, because it still feels personal enough that people actually look.

The space around LinkedIn sales tools has gotten crowded accordingly. Taplio has owned the personal brand and content scheduling lane for a while. Trigify positions itself around high-intent lead identification. Opencord AI is somewhere in the engagement-automation vicinity. The competitive surface is real — which, look, makes sense given the demand signal. If you are a founder, consultant, or sales rep whose livelihood depends on pipeline, LinkedIn is probably the channel you're most actively rethinking right now.

The problem most of these tools are solving around is the same one Extrovert is solving directly: building actual familiarity before the pitch. The cold DM that opens with "I noticed you posted about X" is so transparently templated at this point that it reads as hostile. What actually works — commenting thoughtfully on someone's posts, staying visible in their feed over weeks, existing in their peripheral awareness before you ever ask for anything — is incredibly time-intensive to do manually. It's also the kind of work that gets triaged out of the day the moment a real fire appears.

That tension is where Extrovert is planting its flag. Whether the flag stays planted is the more interesting question.

## The Micro: The Comment Is the Product

Extrovert's core mechanic is not complicated, which is either a strength or a limitation depending on what you need. You tell it who to track — prospects, existing customers, relevant topic threads on LinkedIn — and it monitors their activity. When those people post, Extrovert's AI drafts suggested comments and DMs based on what the company calls your "playbook," a set of parameters presumably defining your tone, goals, and relationship context. You review the suggestions. You send what you like. The pitch is fifteen minutes a day.

According to the product website, Extrovert claims over 1,000 users. The Product Hunt launch pulled 384 upvotes and a #2 daily rank, which is a genuinely strong showing — not "won the week" territory, but solid enough that it's not purely a founder-network vote stack. Fifty comments on the PH thread suggests at least some real conversation happening rather than just thumbs-up-and-leave behavior.

What's notable from the competitive research is that Extrovert apparently started as a commenting-only tool and has since expanded into integrated DM outreach — described by one of the founders on LinkedIn as "the biggest leap forward since we launched." That evolution matters. A tool that only helped you comment on posts is a niche utility. A tool that connects commenting behavior to a broader outreach sequence is trying to be something closer to a lightweight CRM for relationship-based sales.

The AI suggestion layer is the part that's hardest to evaluate from the outside. AI-generated LinkedIn comments have a reputation — and it's not a good one. The entire value proposition of Extrovert collapses if the suggestions read like they were written by someone who has never had a conversation. The "you review and send" framing is doing meaningful work here, positioning the AI as a drafting assistant rather than an autopilot. Whether the drafts are actually good enough to be worth reviewing rather than just rewriting from scratch is something you'd only know after using it.

## The Verdict

Extrovert is solving a real problem in a way that isn't embarrassing, which — in the LinkedIn automation space — clears a higher bar than it sounds like. The instinct to make relationship-building more systematic without making it robotic is correct. The execution question is whether the AI suggestions are actually useful or whether they become one more thing to edit before deleting and typing something real.

At thirty days, I'd want to know what the comment acceptance rate looks like — what percentage of AI suggestions users actually send versus abandon. That number would tell you almost everything about whether the core product is working. At sixty days, the DM outreach integration needs to demonstrate it's more than a bolted-on feature. At ninety, retention is the question: does this become a daily habit or does it get quietly uninstalled the way most LinkedIn productivity tools do?

The 1,000-user claim is encouraging context but not validation. The PH numbers suggest real interest. What Extrovert hasn't proven yet — and can't prove on launch day — is that the AI is good enough to make the fifteen-minutes-a-day promise feel honest rather than optimistic. That's the bet. It's a reasonable one. I'm not ready to call it a sure thing.
