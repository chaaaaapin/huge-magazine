## The Macro: Everyone Agrees Onboarding Is Broken, Nobody Agrees on the Fix

Here's the thing about the customer success software market: it's enormous, it's growing fast, and it has been confidently solving the same problem — user activation — for fifteen years with middling results. Multiple sources peg the customer success platforms market at roughly $1.86 billion in 2024, projected to climb somewhere between $9 and $10 billion by 2032. That's a 22% CAGR, which is the kind of number that makes VCs print a slide deck before breakfast.

And yet. Walk into any SaaS company's Slack and you'll find a channel called something like #onboarding-hell. The standard playbook — a product tour built in Appcues, a drip email sequence, maybe a Loom video someone recorded in 2021 that's now embarrassingly outdated — works fine until it doesn't. Which is to say, it works fine for the users who would have figured it out anyway.

The people who actually need help? They churn before they ever see value.

The incumbents here are not exactly sleeping. Intercom has been pushing AI-assisted support hard. Gainsight and Totango own the enterprise customer success space. Pendo and Appcues own the interactive walkthrough lane. What nobody has really committed to — at least not with a dedicated product — is replacing the live onboarding call itself. That's the specific gap Obi is trying to occupy, which, look, is either a clever niche or a sign that everyone else tried it and quietly moved on. The timing argument is credible though: voice AI quality in 2025 is genuinely different from what it was even eighteen months ago. That's not hype, it's just how the models improved.

## The Micro: A Voice Agent That Shows Up at 2am When Your CSM Doesn't

Obi — built by the team at Cor (getcor.ai) — is a voice AI agent designed to conduct 1:1 onboarding calls with new users. Not a chatbot. Not a tooltip sequence. A voice conversation, on demand, at whatever scale you need, 24/7. The pitch is that a new user can get the kind of guided, responsive setup experience that used to require an actual human CSM — but without scheduling a Zoom, waiting for business hours, or watching a video that doesn't quite answer their question.

The product apparently listens, responds in real time, walks users through their specific setup situation, and then — this is the part that's genuinely interesting — surfaces insights to the team after each session. So you're not just replacing the onboarding call, you're also capturing structured data from it. That's a meaningful product decision: instead of the call being a black hole, it becomes a feedback loop.

Obi 2.0 launched alongside a reported $2 million funding round, according to the company's website. The Product Hunt numbers are modest but respectable — 224 votes, 36 comments, a #5 daily rank. That's not a viral explosion, but it's a real signal of genuine interest rather than coordinated upvoting. The comments are worth watching; 36 on a launch like this usually means people actually have questions rather than just dropping "congrats on the launch" and leaving.

The company claims enterprise names like Anthropic, HubSpot, and Verkada are in the trusted-customer logos on their site — though the case study content visible in the scrape reads like placeholder text, so take the specifics there with a grain of salt until they publish full case studies.

The key technical bet is that voice AI is now good enough to handle the unpredictability of real user questions. That's a meaningful assumption.

## The Verdict

Obi is solving a problem that is genuinely underserved, which is more than you can say for most Product Hunt launches on a given Tuesday. The insight that the onboarding *call* — not the onboarding *tour* — is the format worth replicating is actually sharp. A tooltip tells you what a button does. A conversation figures out what you're actually trying to accomplish.

That said, I'd be cautious about the execution risk here. Voice AI for customer-facing onboarding is not a forgiving context. One confidently wrong answer about a billing setting, one conversation that goes sideways and can't recover gracefully, and you've done more damage than a clunky product tour ever could. The post-session insights feature is the sleeper story — if that data is actually structured and useful, it could be the thing that makes CSMs adopt this enthusiastically rather than tolerating it.

At 30 days I want to see real case studies with actual completion and activation metrics, not logo soup. At 60 days I want to know how it handles edge cases — confused users, non-native speakers, weird product questions outside the training scope. At 90 days, the question is whether the teams using it see measurable improvement in time-to-value for new users.

The $2M raise is seed-sized, which means they're still in prove-it mode. They should be. This is a bet worth watching — just not worth declaring won yet.
