  "headline": "Formaly Thinks Your Google Form Problem Is Actually a Conversation Problem",
  "excerpt": "AI-powered conversational forms are a real category now — the question is whether Formaly has anything the other five tools launching this month don't.",
  "body": "## The Macro: Everyone Hates Forms, Nobody Has Fixed Them\n\nHere's the thing about the form-builder market: it has been \"innovating\" for about fifteen years and the dominant experience is still a vertical stack of labeled boxes that feels like filing your taxes. Typeform made conversational forms a real product category — probably a decade ago now — and somehow the lesson the industry took from that was to add more question types rather than rethink the interaction model entirely.\n\nThe AI wave was always going to hit this space eventually. And now it has, all at once. Formaly is competing in a category that includes GPTForm.ai (listed explicitly as an alternative on SourceForge), plus whatever Typeform's AI features have become, plus approximately eleven other tools that launched on Product Hunt this quarter with some variation of "chat interface meets survey." The crowding is real and worth acknowledging upfront.\n\nWhat makes the timing interesting isn't some abstract AI readiness argument — it's that the underlying completion rate problem is genuinely severe. Formaly's own marketing cites a 30% industry average completion rate for traditional forms, which, look, that number is directionally accurate even if the precise figure is theirs to defend. If you've ever tried to collect post-purchase feedback at scale, you know most people abandon the form before question three. A chat interface that mimics something respondents already do all day on their phones is a reasonable hypothesis for fixing that.\n\nThe A2P messaging market context the research surfaces — $71.7 billion globally in 2024 — is only loosely relevant here. Formaly isn't really a messaging infrastructure play. But the underlying signal is useful: people are extremely comfortable receiving and responding to conversational messages in business contexts. That behavioral norm is what Formaly is trying to borrow.\n\n## The Micro: Prompt In, Form Out, Insights Allegedly Included\n\nThe core loop is genuinely simple, which is either a compliment or a concern depending on how charitable you're feeling. You describe what you want to learn in natural language, Formaly generates a conversational form, respondents answer through a chat interface, and then AI processes the responses into themes, sentiment, and notable quotes. Four steps. The website demo shows the kind of back-and-forth you'd expect — the form asks a question, the user types a response, the form follows up naturally. It reads less like a survey and more like a product manager badgering you in Slack, which is either more or less annoying depending on your relationship with your product manager.\n\nThe AI generation piece is powered by Nebius Token Factory, which the site credits explicitly. That's a notable infrastructure choice — Nebius is the AI cloud spun out of Yandex's international operations — and it suggests the team made a deliberate decision about cost structure and model access rather than just defaulting to the OpenAI API like everyone else.\n\nFormaly lists support for feedback forms, quizzes, and surveys, plus flexible question types, which covers the main use cases without overreaching into territory they'd need to defend. The mobile experience is called out specifically on the site, which matters — completion rates on mobile static forms are measurably worse than desktop, so if the chat interface genuinely closes that gap, that's a real product advantage rather than a vibe.\n\nThe Product Hunt numbers: 294 upvotes, 48 comments, daily rank of #3. That's a solid launch — not a blowout, but enough to suggest genuine interest rather than a coordinated maker network bump. Forty-eight comments is actually a decent engagement ratio for that vote count. People apparently had things to say, which usually means the product is either confusing or interesting. Hopefully the latter.\n\nThe site claims 75%+ completion rates versus the 30% industry average. That's a big claim presented without a source, and I'd want to know what sample size that's sitting on before repeating it to anyone who matters.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nFormaly is a competent entry into a legitimately crowded space, and I mean that more kindly than it sounds. The conversational form category is real, the completion rate problem is real, and an AI that can generate the form from a prompt rather than making you drag-and-drop for twenty minutes is a genuine quality-of-life improvement. The Nebius infrastructure choice is an interesting detail that suggests more technical intentionality than a typical weekend-project launch.\n\nWhat I'd want to know at 30 days: what the actual retention looks like for teams who built a form and got responses. The creation experience is the easy part to demo. The hard part is whether the AI insights layer is genuinely useful or just a sentiment-colored word cloud with extra steps.\n\nAt 60 days: whether anyone is paying, and what the conversion from free to whatever paid tier exists looks like. The website shows a free tier prominently and nothing else, which is a launch-day choice but not a business model.\n\nAt 90 days: how they're differentiating from GPTForm.ai and the inevitable Typeform AI push in a way that isn't just price.\n\nThe product is real. The market is genuinely competitive. Root for them, but ask for the completion rate methodology."
