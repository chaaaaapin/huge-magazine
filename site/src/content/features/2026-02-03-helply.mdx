## The Macro: Everyone Wants to Fire Their Support Queue

Somewhere between the third Zendesk price increase and the fourth consecutive quarter of support headcount growing faster than revenue, a lot of SaaS founders started asking whether human-first customer support was structurally broken. The timing of AI support tools flooding the market is not a coincidence.

The numbers are real. Multiple research firms put the customer success platforms market at roughly $1.86 billion in 2024, with projections ranging from $9 to $9.17 billion by 2032, a CAGR hovering around 22%. That kind of growth rate usually means one of two things: either the category is genuinely expanding, or analysts are being optimistic in a frothy sector. Probably some of both.

What's actually driving the urgency is simpler than market reports make it sound. Support tickets are expensive, repetitive, and deeply unpleasant to staff at scale. The median SaaS company is handling a queue that's roughly 60-70% the same dozen questions asked in slightly different ways.

That's a solvable problem, in theory.

Every major player in the space has noticed. Intercom has Fin, its AI agent layer, live and iterating for over a year. Zendesk has acquired and built its own AI resolution tooling. Freshdesk, Help Scout, Gorgias, all have some version of AI-assisted or AI-first support baked in now. The incumbents have distribution, existing customer data, and integrations already locked in.

Helply's position in this crowd is essentially: we don't just sell you the gun, we guarantee you hit the target. That's a different bet than most competitors are making. Whether it's clever differentiation or an uncomfortable promise to keep depends heavily on what happens in month three.

## The Micro: The Guarantee Is the Product

Helply is an AI support agent. It handles support conversations end-to-end, takes actions inside connected systems, syncs with your existing help desk, and escalates to humans when needed, passing along full context and source citations so the handoff isn't a mess. The demo on their site shows it fetching invoices, surfacing prorated billing details, and doing the small helpful things that eat up a support rep's afternoon.

None of that is technically novel in 2025.

What Helply is actually selling is the 65% resolution rate in 90 days or you pay nothing. That's the product. The AI agent is the mechanism. The outcome guarantee is the offer.

To make that guarantee work operationally, they've built around a dedicated AI support engineer assigned to each customer. A human layer that sits between the software and the outcome. The implication is that setup, training, and tuning aren't left to the customer to figure out. Someone is accountable for whether the number gets hit. That's a real structural decision, and it costs money to run, which makes their unit economics interesting to think about even without the numbers to actually do it.

Helply claims to be trusted by 1,000+ businesses. Their launch logo wall includes names like Streak, Churnkey, and Kami. Recognizable SaaS-adjacent brands, not placeholder logos. It got solid traction on launch day, which suggests genuine interest rather than a coordinated clap circle.

Alex Turnbull is listed as a founder. The same Alex Turnbull who founded Groove, a help desk product with its own established user base in the SMB SaaS segment. If that connection is as direct as LinkedIn suggests, Helply isn't starting from zero on domain credibility or distribution. In a market where trust is the actual product, that matters.

## The Verdict

The guarantee is doing a lot of work here, and the question is whether it's load-bearing or decorative.

A 65% resolution rate is a specific, auditable claim, which is good. The 90-day window is long enough for a genuine implementation cycle, but also long enough that a lot can go wrong quietly before anyone calls the bet. I think this works well for a fairly specific customer profile: B2B SaaS companies with high-volume, pattern-heavy queues. Billing questions, password resets, integration FAQs. That's the sweet spot where a 65% resolution rate is actually achievable and the dedicated engineer model has something real to tune against.

I'm more skeptical about customers with complex, nuanced, or low-volume support scenarios where 65% is structurally unreachable. The guarantee looks different when the math never gets there to begin with, and someone has to eat that cost.

Turnbull's Groove background is the most reassuring signal here. Building in this space for the second time, with presumably hard-won knowledge of where AI support actually succeeds and where it embarrasses you in front of a customer. That's not nothing.

I'd want to see the refund rate at month four before calling this a durable business. But the bet is coherent, the positioning is sharp, and the guarantee is at least a real one. That's more than most launches can say.
